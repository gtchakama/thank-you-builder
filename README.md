# Thank you builder

At GitHub, we like to say thanks to all the folks on our teams that helped with a particular feature launch. This website uses one of GitHub's coolest tricks to help you build out a quick grid of photos with all the people you choose on it.

To use, clone the repository, open the .html file, and fill the text box with the GitHub handles of all the people you're looking to thank. You can use your browser's zoom (cmd +/- on a Mac) to change the size of the photos, or use the browser's dev tools to change the background color to suit your needs. Checking "Square grid" uses a more compressed layout that omits handles and shows square avatars. Then just screenshot the results and paste into your slides. :tada:
