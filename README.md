# Thank you builder

At GitHub, we like to say thanks to all the folks on our teams that helped with a particular feature launch. This website uses one of GitHub's coolest tricks to help you build out a quick grid of photos with all the people you choose on it.

To use, simply navigate to [https://jhutchings1.github.io/thank-you-builder/](https://jhutchings1.github.io/thank-you-builder/), and enter the set of GitHub handles you want to celebrate. The app includes a couple of simple settings for image sizes, or changing from square to round avatars. When you're done, just screenshot the results and paste into your slides. :tada:
